IPC 
 	

 	Pipes: Unidirectional communication between processes.
	Message Queues: Message-based communication, allowing data to be sent in discrete chunks.
	Shared Memory: Processes can access a shared region of memory.
	Sockets: Network sockets enable IPC between processes on different machines.
	Semaphores: Used for synchronization and coordination between processes.
	Signals: Processes can send signals to each other to notify events.
	FIFOs (Named Pipes): Special files for process communication.
	System V IPC: Provides mechanisms like message queues, shared memory, and semaphores.



thread vs process in c 

In C, a process is an independent program with its memory, while a thread is a lightweight execution unit within a process sharing memory, making communication more efficient but challenging to manage.


function pointer
A function pointer in C is a variable that can store the address of a function. It enables dynamic selection and invocation of functions at runtime, providing flexibility and extensibility in software design.

	#include <stdio.h>
	// Two functions with the same signature
	int add(int a, int b) {
    	return a + b;
	}

	int subtract(int a, int b) {
    	return a - b;
	}

	int main() {
    	int (*operation)(int, int);  // Declare a function pointer

    	operation = add;  // Point it to the "add" function
    	int result = operation(5, 3);  // Call the function using the pointer

    	printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    	operation = subtract;  // Point it to the "subtract" function
    	result = operation(5, 3);  // Call the function using the pointer

    	printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    	return 0;
	}



 const int a vs int const a	
 both case don't change the value of a



 Static Variables:
	A static variable is one that persists its value between function calls and retains its value throughout the program's execution.


Const Variables:
A const variable is one whose value cannot be modified after initialization.


in C, the volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value can change at any time, often due to external factors not controlled by the program, such as hardware or concurrent threads. It prevents the compiler from optimizing away accesses to the variable, ensuring its value is always read from or written to memory.



Structure padding aligns data within a structure for efficient memory access, which can improve performance and hardware compatibility. However, it may increase memory usage. Without padding, memory usage is more efficient but may result in slower access times and compatibility issues on some architectures. The choice depends on the specific needs of the application.



Enums in C are used to create named integral constants, providing a more readable and maintainable alternative to using plain integers for options, flags, or codes. They enhance code clarity and reduce the risk of errors.

Common use cases for enums in C include:
Options and Flags: Enums are useful for representing various options, settings, or bit flags, making code more self-explanatory. For example, defining colors, file modes, or bitwise operations.
State Machines: Enums can represent states in a finite state machine, simplifying state transitions and improving code readability.
Error Codes: Enums can be used to define error codes, making it easier to identify and handle specific errors.
Constants: Enums provide a way to define named constants for values that are not meant to change during program execution
Menu Options: In user interfaces or command-line applications, enums help define menu options, enhancing user interaction and code organization.
APIs: When defining function interfaces or APIs, enums can clarify the meaning of function parameters and return values.
Overall, enums enhance code readability, maintainability, and robustness by providing meaningful names for integral constants and reducing the risk of using incorrect values in your code.



C is one of the most common programming languages used in multiple applications, including but not limited to web development, system programming, embedded systems, etc.

Embedded C is an extension of the C programming language, specifically designed for embedded systems. From their creators to their uses, there are several, albeit minor differences between the two.

1. Task in FreeRTOS:
- A task in FreeRTOS is the smallest unit of work or execution. It's a function or a sequence of instructions that can run concurrently with other tasks in a multitasking environment.
- Each task operates independently, with its own stack and execution context.

2. Task Priorities:
- In FreeRTOS, each task is assigned a priority value that determines its execution order and preemptive behavior. Lower numeric values represent higher priorities.
- The scheduler ensures that the task with the highest priority that is ready to run is executed. Tasks with the same priority are scheduled in a round-robin manner.

3. Task Creation:
- To create a task in FreeRTOS, you typically provide a function that represents the task's code, the task's name, its stack size, and its priority.
- For example:
xTaskCreate(TaskFunction, "TaskName", StackSize, NULL, Priority, &TaskHandle);

4. Idle Task:
- The Idle task is a built-in task in FreeRTOS with the lowest priority. It runs when no other tasks are ready to execute.
- The Idle task is responsible for freeing memory and providing a low-power mode if supported by the hardware.

5. Timer Service Task:
- The Timer Service task is another built-in task in FreeRTOS that handles software timers and delays.
- It is responsible for managing timer events, allowing you to create periodic tasks and timed delays.

6. Task Synchronization and Communication:
- Tasks in FreeRTOS can communicate and synchronize their activities using various synchronization primitives, such as semaphores, mutexes, queues, and event groups.
- These mechanisms help prevent data races and allow tasks to cooperate and share data safely.

7. Task States:
- A task in FreeRTOS can be in one of several states: ready, running, blocked, or suspended.
- The scheduler transitions tasks between these states based on their readiness to execute and priority.

8. Task Suspension and Deletion:
- You can suspend a task, which temporarily halts its execution without deleting it. A suspended task can be resumed later.
- Task deletion permanently removes a task and releases its resources, including stack memory.

9. Task Stack Size:
- Each task has its own stack memory, and you must specify the stack size when creating a task. The stack size depends on the task's code and usage of local variables.

10. Task Watchdogs:
- FreeRTOS provides a task watchdog feature that allows you to monitor task execution and reset the microcontroller in case a task fails to respond within a specified time frames.


UDP and tcp

socket and mqtt
	Communication Model:

	Sockets provide a low-level, point-to-point communication model where data is sent directly from one endpoint to another.
	MQTT uses a publish-subscribe model, allowing multiple clients to subscribe to specific topics and receive messages published on those topics, enabling many-to-many communication.

Protocol Abstraction:
	Sockets are a low-level, protocol-agnostic interface that can be used with various network protocols, including TCP and UDP.
	MQTT is a higher-level, application-layer protocol specifically designed for messaging and event-based communication, built on top of lower-level protocols like TCP/IP.	



Recusrsive function
		#include <stdio.h>

	// Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
	unsigned long long factorial(int n) {
    	if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    	} else {
        	return n * factorial(n - 1);
    	}
	}

	int main() {
	    int num = 5;
	    unsigned long long result = factorial(num);
	    printf("Factorial of %d is %llu\n", num, result);
	    return 0;
	}		


An interrupt subroutine, or ISR (Interrupt Service Routine), is a program triggered by hardware or software interrupts, allowing immediate handling of specific events without disrupting normal program flow.	



A segmentation fault in C, often denoted as a "segfault," is a runtime error that occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that it's not allowed to access. It typically happens due to:

Dereferencing a null pointer.
Attempting to read or write to memory that the program doesn't have access to.
Writing data to a read-only portion of memory.
Stack overflow, often caused by excessive recursion or exceeding the stack's memory limit.
Segmentation faults can lead to program crashes and are typically caused by programming errors, like accessing an uninitialized pointer or overrunning a buffer. They are critical for diagnosing and debugging issues in C programs.







// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>  // For input and output

int main() {  // Start of the program

    char str1[100], str2[100];  // Spaces for user's strings
    int i = 0;  // Counter for going through strings

    // Get strings from the user
    printf("Enter the first string: ");
    scanf("%s", str1);

    printf("Enter the second string: ");
    scanf("%s", str2);

    // Go through and compare the strings
    while (str1[i] == str2[i] && str1[i] != '\0') {
        i++;
    }

    if (str1[i] > str2[i]) {
        printf("String 1 comes after String 2.\n");
    } else if (str1[i] < str2[i]) {
        printf("String 1 comes before String 2.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Both strings are the same.\n");
    }

    return 0;  // End the program

}
