Definition: A mutex is a synchronization primitive used to manage access to a shared resource in concurrent programming.

Purpose: It prevents race conditions by ensuring that only one thread or process can access a resource at a time.

Locking Mechanism:

Lock: A thread locks the mutex before accessing the shared resource.
Unlock: The thread unlocks the mutex after finishing the operation.
Blocking: If a thread attempts to lock a mutex that is already locked, it may be blocked until the mutex becomes available.

Ownership: Mutexes are typically owned by the thread that locks them, preventing other threads from unlocking it.

Deadlocks: Care must be taken to avoid deadlocks, where two or more threads wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.

Types: There are different types of mutexes, such as:

Binary Mutex: Only two states (locked/unlocked).
Recursive Mutex: Allows the same thread to lock it multiple times.
Performance: While mutexes ensure safety, they can introduce overhead and reduce performance due to locking and unlocking operations.

Use Cases: Commonly used in multi-threaded applications, such as databases, operating systems, and web servers.

Libraries: Many programming languages and frameworks provide built-in support for mutexes, such as pthreads in C, std::mutex in C++, and threading modules in Python.

This should give you a clear understanding of what mutexes are and their role in concurrent programming!

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);

    // Print the final value of the counter

Explanation
Includes: The code includes necessary headers for pthreads and standard I/O.

Shared Resource: An integer counter is declared to be incremented by multiple threads.

Mutex Declaration: A mutex mutex is declared to control access to counter.

Thread Function:

The increment function is defined, which increments the counter a specified number of times.
It locks the mutex before modifying the counter and unlocks it afterward, ensuring only one thread can modify counter at a time.
Main Function:

The mutex is initialized with pthread_mutex_init.
Multiple threads are created, each executing the increment function.
The main thread waits for all child threads to finish using pthread_join.
Finally, the mutex is destroyed with pthread_mutex_destroy, and the final value of counter is printed.
