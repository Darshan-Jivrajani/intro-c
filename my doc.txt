C 
structure ;-  memory req max data type
uniuon ;- sum of all variable

stack:- last input is 1st out put 	

queue:- 1st input is 1st output

tree:- 
	root node is connect with multiple sub node and make tree

char         4
int            4
double     8
data stuck:- 
	array – same data types
	structure and unioun ;- same and diffrent data type


Storage Class
auto – memotry assisgned
extern – one file to other file
register
	This storage class declares register variables that have the same functionality as that of the auto variables. The only difference is that the compiler tries to store these variables in the register of the microprocessor if a free registration is available.

Static
static is used with global variables and functions to set their scope to the containing file.


malloc() allocates a memory block of given size (in bytes) and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block. malloc() doesn’t initialize the allocated memory. 

calloc() allocates the memory and also initializes every byte in the allocated memory to

const char* and char const* says that the pointer can point to a constant char and value of char pointed by this pointer cannot be changed.

The memory leak occurs, when a piece of memory which was previously allocated by the programmer. Then it is not deallocated properly by programmer. That memory is no longer in use by the program

call by value vs call by ref.
recursion in c
write a program to swap two number without using the third variable
print factorial without using recusrion
find repeted char in string
find occurrence of a word in given string
